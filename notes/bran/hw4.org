** Question 1

The main function calls in main is =InternetGetConnectedState=.
If the host can connect to the internet, it calls an internal function
=sub 0x40105F=, which proceeds to run this massive code construct.

** Question 2
This massive code construct at =sub 0x40105F= that seems to be a Microsoft
Visual C++ runtime Library call based on the it's complexity and numerous
internal functions. There are lots of dynamic memory calls related to
=malloc= or =heaps=.  
** Question 3
Performing dynamic analysis shows that the program simply prints "Connected
to internet" if the can and "Error 1.1 No Internet" depending on the outcome
of =InternetGetConnectedState=. One might conclude then, the funcition at
=sub 0x40105F= is something along the lines of a =printf= statement from the
system library.
